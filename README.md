# Video Game Sales - Clustering Project

I will work with a [dataset](https://github.com/serapumut/Clustering_Project-Video_Games_Sales/blob/main/global_video_game_sales.csv) offering a detailed overview of video game sales across different regions, platforms, genres, and publishers.

More information related to the dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samanfatima7/cleaned-global-video-game-sales-dataset).

Problem Statement: Can we group video games into different clusters based on their attributes (e.g., genre, platform, release date, developer) to uncover hidden patterns? 

Approach: This would be a clustering problem using algorithms like K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering to explore similarities between different types of games.
