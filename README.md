# Video Game Sales - Clustering Project

I will work with a [dataset](https://github.com/serapumut/Clustering_Project-Video_Games_Sales/blob/main/global_video_game_sales.csv) offering a detailed overview of video game sales across different regions, platforms, genres, and publishers.

More information related to the dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samanfatima7/cleaned-global-video-game-sales-dataset).
